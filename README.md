AMAZING EVENTS

This is the second mindhub project. If you decided to continue with the bootcamp, welcome, it's going to be a difficult few weeks.

In this case, the different stages of the project can be found in the commits and the pull requests.
Advice, do not hang up or postpone deliveries, always ask the mentors any doubts and become very good companions in the groups.
The company is key at this stage, do not feel useless, the impostor syndrome is going to be present many times.

Take the repository as merely inspirational, the ideal is that you do it yourself and do not copy code, it is not difficult. Just laborious.

PS: due to the closure of the free APIs on Heroku, download the JSON and it is saved in the root of the project.
To reload the remote API it is only a matter of changing the first line of the .JS files, In the "link" variable you only change the string for the url.

Good luck.
